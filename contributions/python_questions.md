### Question 1
Write a function that given a year as an input, determines whether it is a leap year. If it is a leap year, return the Boolean True, otherwise return False.
**For example**
```python
def leap_year_checker(year):
    #code that checks if it is a leap year
```

The input format is an integer (year) and the output format is a boolean(True or False).
***Note:*** There are multiple solutions to this question so feel free to be creativeðŸ˜ƒ

### Question 3
Write a function that finds the mode in a list of numbers.
**Example**
```python
def mode(lst):
    #code to find the mode in the list
```
The input is a list of numbers and the output is the number with the highest number of occurences (mode). If there are multiple modes, return the smallest one.
The function should not involve any python module imports, or the ```max``` function.
